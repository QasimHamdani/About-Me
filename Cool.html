<h1 style="color:rgb(255, 102, 0);">Top 5 Lacrosse Players of all Time!!!</h1>
<p></p>
<h1 style="color:rgb(255, 102, 0);">#5 Chazz Woodson</h1>
<img src="chazz.jpg" width="400" height="450">
<p style="color:rgb(55, 255, 0);">At number five is Chazz Woodson, the original king of the lacrosse highlight reel and the man who made air time an art form. Known for his gravity-defying dives and ankle-breaking moves, Chazz turned every game into a mixtape moment</p>
<p></p>
<h1 style="color:rgb(255, 102, 0);">#4 Lyle Thompson</h1>
<img src="Lyle.jpg" width="400" height="450">
<p style="color:rgb(55, 255, 0);">At number four is Lyle Thompson, the human highlight reel with hair that deserves its own trophy. Raised on the Onondaga Nation, he plays lacrosse with style, grace, and creativity that leaves defenders dizzy and fans speechless.</p>
<p></p>
<h1 style="color:rgb(255, 102, 0);">#3 Gary Gait</h1>
<img src="Gait.jpg" width="400" height="450">
<p style="color:rgb(55, 255, 0);">At number three is Gary Gait, the legend who basically reinvented lacrosse while making it look easy. If creativity had a face, it would probably be his. From behind-the-back passes to the iconic “Air Gait” leap over the crease, Gary didn’t just play the game—he changed it..</p>
<p></p>
<h1 style="color:rgb(255, 102, 0);">#2 Mikey Powell</h1>
<img src="Powell.jpeg" width="400" height="450">
<p style="color:rgb(55, 255, 0);">At number two is Mikey Powell, the wizard of lacrosse and the human embodiment of how did he just do that? Standing only 5’9”, he played like a giant, slicing through defenses with jukes so filthy they should’ve come with a warning label.</p>
<p></p>
<h1 style="color:rgb(255, 102, 0);">#1 John Grant Jr</h1>
<img src="jgjr.jpeg" width="400" height="450">
<p style="color:rgb(55, 255, 0);">At number one is John Grant Jr., the ultimate cheat code in human form. With a stick in his hands, physics stopped making sense—he could fake out a goalie, a defense, and probably a few fans in the stands all at once.</p>
